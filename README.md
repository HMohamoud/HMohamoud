### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a DevOps-focused engineer with a strong interest in scalable infrastructure, cloud automation, and systems reliability.

My work centers around building clean, efficient environments, automating workflows, and driving continuous operational improvement.

Currently, I’m pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at City, University of London, where I’m deepening my understanding of software systems, distributed computing, and modern DevOps practices.
